Website I made for SEG3525: Design and analysis of user interfaces.

The project was organized like this:
* Week 1: Design the UI mockup.
* Week 2: Review other student's UI.
* Week 3: Receive reviews and make first iteration of the website.
* Week 4: Review other student's first iterations.
* Week 5 and 6: Make the final version.

The website was made using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/). The fake data was generated using [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
